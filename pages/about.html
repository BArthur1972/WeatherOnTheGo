                “Weather On The Go” is not the average weather app.
                It provides the user with basic
                features such as the temperature, humidity, possibility
                of rain, wind speed, and the clarity of the sky.
                However, this app specializes in telling the user the
                weather based on their desired location or current location. Also, our app goes
                the extra mile to be interactive with the user by
                providing suggestions on what to wear and some activities to engage in.
                The goal is to provide a personalized experience
                when the user looks at the weather and plans their day.

            <h2>The Purpose</h2>
            <p>
                The purpose of "Weather on The Go" is to provide
                a user experience unlike most weather apps. It is a user experience that is much more personal and
                prepares
                you for the weather. Our app is designed to give you suggestions such as
                "wearing a raincoat" or "you can take a walk at the park" in order
                to directly interact with the user. Additionally, we wanted to fill the
                void of curiosty. Some users may simply be curious about how other areas
                differ in terms of weather.

            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <p>
                Using "Weather On The Go" is a simple, straightforward process.
                The app first will provide weather information based on your current
                location using geolocation technology. Also,
                you can use the search bar on our "Home" page in order to learn
                about the weather in a different location from your own.

            <h2>The Creation Process</h2>
            <p>
                "Weather on The Go" uses technologies such as HTML, CSS,
                and JavaScript. Also, we used GitHub for a collaboration tool.
                Lastly, we used the OpenWeatherMap API and the Unsplash Image API.
                These tools allow for the weather to be accessed, and allow images
                to be shown to the user which are related to the type of weather
                that is occurring.

            <h2>Who Are We?</h2>
            <p>
                Hello! We are a group of students at Fisk University that were tasked
                to create a website of our choice. We started with ideas of creating a
                journaling system, a calender-like app, and a weather-based app.
                As a result, we were able to agree upon an app that would piece together
                all of our ideas. Therefore, we decided to create a weather app with a personalized
                touch to it. This is done through giving suggestions to the user such as what can be
                worn and what activites can be performed based on the weather.
            </p>

            <h2>The Future</h2>
            <p>
                The future of "Weather on The Go" involves possibly a
                dark mode, and there may be a future to log in your activities
                into a log or calendar based similar. This would be a daily system
                based on an account-like system. The user would be able to create an
                account for "Weather On The Go" which would then be used to keep a log
                of all your activities in a database.
