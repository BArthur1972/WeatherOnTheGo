<h2>Project Description</h2>

“Weather On The Go” provides the user with basic features such as the temperature, humidity, possibility of rain,
wind speed, and the clarity of the sky. This app specializes in telling the user the weather based on their desired 
location and goes the extra mile to be interactive with the user by providing suggestions on what to wear and some
activities to engage in. The goal is to provide a personalized experience when the user looks at the weather and plans their day.
